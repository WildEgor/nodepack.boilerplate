# Nodepack Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for creating a new Node.js package. It includes a basic package structure, a simple example, and
a test suite.

## Usage

To use this boilerplate, you can clone this repository and then remove the `.git` directory to start fresh.

git clone
cd nodepack-boilerplate
yarn install
yarn start:dev
